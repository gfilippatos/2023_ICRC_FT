\abstract{
	The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon II (EUSO-SPB2) is scheduled for launch from Wanaka, New Zealand in April/May 2023. 
	Consisting of two optical telescopes, EUSO-SPB2 will search for very high energy neutrinos (E>PeV) via Cherenkov radiation, and ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E>EeV) via ultraviolet fluorescence. 
	Building on the EUSO-Balloon (2014) and EUSO-SPB1 (2017) missions, the Fluorescence Telescope (FT) comprises 108 multi-anode photomultiplier tubes at the focus of a one meter entrance diameter Schmidt telescope. 
	The FT will point down at the atmosphere below the SPBâ€™s altitude of 33 km. The mission duration could reach up to 100 days. 
	Prior to flight, the instrument was extensively tested in the laboratory and in the field. 
	These measurements, combined with extensive simulations lead to an expected peak energy sensitivity around 3 EeV. 
	Combined with a three-times-larger field-of-view than previous EUSO balloon missions, this results in an expected observation rate of one UHECR shower per ten hours of observation. 
	The FT is expected to perform the first measurement of UHECRs via fluorescence from sub-orbital space. 
	These observations will serve as a stepping stone to future satellite-based missions, such as Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, with enormous exposure to the highest energy UHECRs with all sky coverage.
	In this contribution we will discuss the performance of the FT in flight as well as preliminary results.
